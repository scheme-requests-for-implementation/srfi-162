<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
This SRFI provides a few extra procedures and comparators to go
with SRFI 128, Comparators.  Implementers are urged to add them to
their SRFI 128 libraries, for which reason they are not packaged
as a separate library.
</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

None at present.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The original specification for comparators was SRFI 114.  This
was a large and complex SRFI with many procedures and comparators;
its sample implementation had many bugs.  I replaced it with <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-128/srfi-128.html"> SRFI 128</a>,
which is much simpler and cleaner.  However, I now believe that
SRFI 114 was cut back too far.  In particular, there are no comparators
(as opposed to comparator constructors) in SRFI 128.  This SRFI
provides the comparators of SRFI 114 that seem generally useful, so as to have
them generally available without needing to define them locally.</p>

<p>The SRFI 114 procedures <code>comparator-max</code> and
<code>comparator-min</code> have also been restored because they
are equivalent to the <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> methods
of the Haskell typeclass <code>Ord</code>.  Comparators are equivalent
to the three typeclasses <code>Eq</code>, <code>Ord</code>, and
<code>Hashable</code>, but the first and last typeclass do not
provide any additional methods not already available in SRFI 128
except inequality, which is normally not provided by Scheme
libraries.  Equivalent procedures that accept a list have also been added.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2 id="Procedures">Procedures</h2>
<p><code>(comparator-max </code><em>comparator obj<sub>1</sub> obj<sub>2</sub></em> ...<code>)</code>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><code>(comparator-min </code><em>comparator obj<sub>1</sub> obj<sub>2</sub></em> ...<code>)</code>
</p>
<p><code>(comparator-max-in-list </code><em>comparator list</em><code>)</code>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><code>(comparator-min-in-list </code><em>comparator list</em><code>)</code>
</p>
<p>
These procedures are analogous to <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> respectively,
but may be applied to any orderable objects, not just to real numbers. They
apply the ordering procedure of <i>comparator</i> to the <i>objects</i> to find
and return a minimal (or maximal) object. The order in which the
values are compared is unspecified.
If two objects are equal in the sense of the comparator, either may be returned.
</p>

<p>The <code>-in-list</code> versions accept a single list argument.</p>

<h2 id="Useful-comparators">Useful comparators</h2>
<p>
These comparators are useful for comparing standard Scheme types, and
should be more efficient than default comparators.
</p>

<p>
<code>default-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
A pre-created default comparator.
It should behave exactly like a comparator returned by SRFI 128
<code>make-default-comparator</code>.
</p>

<p>
The following pre-created comparators must provide both ordering predicates and
hash functions.  They behave exactly like comparators returned from the
example calls on <code>make-comparator</code> shown in SRFI 128.
</p>

<p>
<code>boolean-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
A comparator for booleans such that <code>#f</code> compares before <code>#t</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>real-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
A comparator for real numbers such that smaller numbers compare before larger numbers.
</p>

<p>
<code>char-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
A comparator for characters using Unicode codepoint order.</p>
<p></p>

<p>
<code>char-ci-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
A comparator for characters using <code>char-ci&lt;?</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>string-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
A comparator for strings using the implementation-specific
definition of <code>string&lt;?</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>string-ci-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
A comparator for strings using the implementation-specific
definition of <code>string-ci&lt;?</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>pair-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
Compares pairs as if by the application of <code>make-pair-comparator</code>
to pairs with <code>default-comparator</code> as the car and cdr comparators.
</p><p>
<code>list-comparator</code>
</p>

<p>
Compares lists as if by the application of <code>make-list-comparator</code> to lists
with <code>default-comparator</code> as the element comparator.
</p>

<p>
<code>vector-comparator</code>
</p>
<p>
Compares vectors as if by the application of <code>make-vector-comparator</code> to vectors
with <code>default-comparator</code> as the element comparator.
</p>

<p>The following comparators behave exactly like the comparators
returned by calls to <code>make-eq-comparator</code>,
<code>make-eqv-comparator</code>,
and <code>make-equal-comparator</code> respectively.
</p>

<p><code>(eq-comparator)</code></p>

<p><code>(eqv-comparator)</code></p>

<p><code>(equal-comparator)</code></p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>The sample implementation is found in a single file in the repository of this
SRFI named <code>srfi-162-impl.scm</code>.  It should simply be included in
whichever SRFI 128 library is in use by the implementation.  It is important
to include it <i>after</i> all other files.  It is also necessary to
extend the library exports to include the two new procedures and
ten new comparators.</p>

<p>In addition, a copy of the Chibi version of the SRFI 128 sample
implementation is also provided, with the implementation file provided
and the various library files appropriately extended.</p>
